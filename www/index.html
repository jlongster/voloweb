        Are you tired of repeating yourself when building web sites? 
        <strong>Volo</strong> is a tool which lets you
        quickly <strong>create</strong> projects, <strong>add</strong>
        libraries, <strong>build</strong> them into optimized
        formats, and <strong>deploy</strong> them. All with a few keystrokes.

        Just type <code>volo &lt;command&gt;</code> and you'll be able to:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Quickly add javascript libraries</strong>: Just tell
            volo the library name or a raw URL, and volo will find it,
            add it and all dependencies, and convert it into an AMD
            module if needed.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Automatically compile Less and
              Coffeescript</strong>: Volo will watch your files for
            changes and automatically compile them. This is builtin to
            volo's development server. (TODO)
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Fire up a development server</strong>: View your
            site over HTTP if you don't already have a server-side
            component set up. This also compiles your Less and
            Coffeescript for you.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Build your site optimally</strong>: Concatenate and
            minify all your CSS and js with one build command. Volo uses
            r.js to flatten all your AMD modules and CSS files and
            minimize them.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Deploy straight to github</strong>: If your site
            is all client-side, you can publish to github with one
            command. Your site is live within seconds.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Manage the appcache</strong>: Make or update an
            appcache with one simple command. Never worry about adding
            files or changing the appcache version again.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <em>(work in progress)</em>

        <p>
          Add your own commands easily, and install commands from the
          community. Every volo project has a file
          called <code>volofile</code> at the root which is just a list
          of commands implemented in javascript. You can easily add your
          own commands.
        </p>

        <p>
          Volo commands are also available via <code>npm</code>. For
          example, to install the ghdeploy command, simply run
          <code>npm install volo-ghdeploy</code>.
